# Solder 201 Workshop Build

## Overview

The Solder 201 Workshop builds on our previous 101 Workshop where we solderd our led badges. This workshop will introduce you to a number of electronic components such as resistors, variable resistors, capacitors, leds and intergrated cricuits. We will build up our PCBs one component at a time. 

## Parts

The parts bellow are broken up in two sections, components and hardware.

## PCB Assembly 

In the next steps we will place and solder are components. The board is silkscreened with markings for each component. The list bellow will help you identify where the components will be placed on your board. 

* C = Capacitor
* R = Resistor
* D = Diod/LED
* RP = Potentiometer Resistor

### Resistors

#### 10k Resistor 

We will need to bend the legs of our resistors to fit through our PCBs as shown bellow. Each strip of resistors has a number written on the bottom. We will start off with the ones marked 10. Resistors are non polar, which means it doesn't matter which way we place them.

We will place two of our 10k resistors at R2 and R4.  You can solder and clip the leads of each resistor when finished placing them.

#### 22k Resistor

The next component will be our 22k Resistors, repeat the same process as the 10k Resistors and place and solder your 22k resistor at R1.

#### 330 Ohm Resistor

Our final 330 Ohm Resistor can be solder down in the spot marked R3.
