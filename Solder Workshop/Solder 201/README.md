# Solder 201 Workshop Build

## Overview

The Solder 201 Workshop builds on our previous 101 Workshop where we solderd our led badges. This workshop will introduce you to a number of electronic components such as resistors, variable resistors, capacitors, leds and intergrated cricuits. We will build up our PCBs one component at a time. 

## Parts

The parts bellow are broken up in two sections, components and hardware.
