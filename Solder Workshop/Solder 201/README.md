## Overview

The Solder 201 Workshop builds on our previous 101 Workshop where we solderd our led badges. This workshop will introduce you to a number of electronic components such as resistors, variable resistors, capacitors, leds and integrated circuits. We will build up our PCBs one component at a time. 

## Parts

The parts bellow are broken up in two sections, components and hardware.

## PCB Assembly 

In the next steps we will place and solder are components. The board is silkscreened with markings for each component. The list bellow will help you identify where the components will be placed on your board. 

* C = Capacitor
* R = Resistor
* D = Diod/LED
* RP = Potentiometer Resistor

### Resistors

A resistors function is to limit current through a circuit. This is done by converting excessive current into heat. Resistors are rated in Ohms Î©.  We will need to bend the legs of our resistors to fit through our PCBs as shown bellow. Each strip of resistors has a number written on the bottom denoting their resistance.  Resistors are non polar, which means it doesn't matter which way we place them.

#### 10k Ohm Resistor 

We will place two of our 10k resistors at R2 and R4.  You can solder and clip the leads of each resistor when finished placing them.

#### 22k Ohm Resistor

The next component will be our 22k resistor, repeat the same process as the 10k resistors and place and solder your 22k resistor at R1.

#### 330 Ohm Resistor

Our final 330 resistor can be solder down in the spot marked R3.

### Capacitors

Capacitors act as an electric reserve to store energy in the form of an electric field. They help smooth out voltage drops across circuits. Each capacitor has a farad rating, or microfarad rating in this case, printed on its side. This is the number you see before the "uF" on each capacitor. The resistor below has a microfarad rating of 1 uF.

Unlike resistors, our capacitors in this circuit are polar, meaning we must solder them in a specific direction. The negative leg of the capacitor is marked with a white stripe. This white stripe matches up with the shaded area on our silkscreened PCB.

#### 470uF Capacitor

We will start off placing and soldering our largest capacitor in the C1 spot on our board.

#### 10uF Capacitor

We can now do the same with our 10uf capacitors in the C2 and C6 location.

#### 1uF Capacitor

The final batch of our 1uF capacitors will go in the C3, C4, and C5 locations.

### Potentiometers

Potentiometers function as a variable resistor. It allows someone to tune the resistance in their circuit. You have probably used potentiometers to control the volume on stereo or television. 

The kit includes two potentiometers, one will control the volume the second will control the LED sensitivity.

Place the potentiometer marked "503" in the "Volume potentiometer" location. Place the "103" potentiometer in the "Music Level potentiometer" location. You do not need to clip the leads after soldering these components.

### Integrated Circuits (IC)

The development of of integrated circuits catapulted technology to where it is today. They drive our phones, computers, televisions, and much more. We are able to pack a complex circuits into compact and reliable packages. 

#### KA2284 Linear Integrated Circuit 

The KA2284 IC is designed to drive the 5-Dot LED level meter on our board. Take note of the notch on the one side of the IC. This will line up with the notch illustrated on the board. Like the potentiometers, you do not need to worry about clipping the leads.

### LEDs

Our final component is our LEDs. Remember to line up your positive leads with the + sign on the board. From left to right your LEDs should go Green-Green-Green-Yellow-Red.
