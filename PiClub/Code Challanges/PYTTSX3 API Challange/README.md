# Code Challenge #1

By now you've had experience using Python's text-to-speech library and navigating basic APIs to pull data from the web into your programs. 

Your challenge is to take our recent Anime API example and combine it with the Jokes API example to have Python read out random anime quotes. 

Bellow are links to both projects. First person to  successfully create their code and share it will win the challenge! Good Luck!
